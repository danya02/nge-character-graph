# NGE Character Graph
[_Neon Genesis Evangelion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) is a Japanese anime TV series that 
appears to have been made deliberately confusing. In fact, the ending 
is so confusing that it had given the creators the dubious honor of 
naming the corresponding trope, the [Gainax Ending](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding).
 
This is the reason for this project. It aims to create a graph, where 
the characters are represented by vertices, and the relationships 
that they have as edges. In a hilarious twist, this actually can make 
it _harder_ to understand the relationships that they have, since a 
simple graph doesn't describe the passage of time, and some events 
that have created connections between characters are time-separated.
